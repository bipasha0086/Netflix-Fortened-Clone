# Netflix-Fortened-Clone


This is a **static clone** of the **Netflix homepage UI**, created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It replicates the visual layout of the Netflix landing page including the navigation bar, hero banner, movie thumbnails, hover animations, and footer. This project is purely front-end and is meant for design/UI practice — it is **not responsive** and contains no dynamic backend functionality.
